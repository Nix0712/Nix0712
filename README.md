## Hi there! 👋 I'm Nikola

I'm a 3rd-year Computer Engineering and Informatics student at the University of Belgrade, School of Electrical Engineering. I’m passionate about exploring different areas of technology, from web development to embedded systems and operating systems. As I continue my studies, I enjoy experimenting with new projects and expanding my skill set.

🔭 Current Projects & Interests

I’m still exploring and learning, and here are a few of my key projects so far:

    🌦️ WeatherApp: A web application built using React, which fetches real-time weather data via APIs.
    🔧 RISC-V xv6-based OS: A minimal operating system for RISC-V architecture, where I explored systems programming and hardware-software interactions.
    ❤️ Arduino EKG Monitor: Built an EKG monitor with Arduino, delving into embedded systems, signal processing, and circuit design.

🛠️ Tech Stack

    Languages: C, C++, JavaScript, Python
    Frameworks: React
    Tools: Arduino, Git, Linux

🚀 Future Goals

I’m continuously learning and discovering new areas of software engineering. Whether it’s developing web applications, diving deeper into low-level systems, or exploring embedded hardware, I’m excited about where my journey will take me!
